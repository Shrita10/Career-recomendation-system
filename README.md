Most students after graduation are open to innumerable job roles. Some of the students are good at analysis while some are good at development. 
Being open to a bunch of job roles might be confusing as it is difficult to analyze the best fit for yourself and match the interest.
The goal of my model would be to find the best job role for students.
On the other hand, my model can also predict the chances of getting an admit from their desired university
